<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Disney Death Tour provides an emplaced critique at the site of Disney
World’s Magic Kingdom in order to memorialize those who have lost their lives
at the park. By constructing digital, and therefore unremovable, monuments at
the locations of the many deaths that Disney has sought to cover up, this
project challenges the dominant narratives of the park while reflecting on the
abject sacrifices endemic to the tourist industry.</p>

<h3>An Undertaking in Critical Tourism</h3>
<p><i>“[T]he process of MEmorializing begins with a sting (punctum) received from a news item, a story from
the daily dose of information circulated by journalism.”—Gregory L. Ulmer, Electronic Monuments</i></p>
<p><i>“A Walt Disney World custodian plunged 40 feet to his death Sunday morning after clinging to the
outside of a rising cable car that had swept him from a platform.”—Orlando Sentinel, 14 February, 1999</i></p>

<p>Our Disney Death Tour starts with a single tragedy:</p>
<blockquote>Raymond Barlow, 65, was on a platform for the Skyway in Fantasyland when the cable-car
ride was switched on for the park's opening, sending one of the gondolas toward the part-time worker.
The startled Clermont resident grabbed the four-person gondola and struggled to pull himself inside,
park employees told investigators. On the way up, he apparently was looking for a place to land and
let go over a flower bed, snapping some tree branches on the way down, the workers said.
<br>(“Worker At Disney Plunges To His Death”)</blockquote>

<p>The Skyway from which he fell was torn down six months later. Although Disney was fined $4,500
for “a ‘serious’ violation of safety standards,” The Orlando Sentinel reported that, “The ride's
closing is not a result of any concerns about its safety.” Bob Sehlinger, author of The Unofficial
Guide to Walt Disney World, commented, “The five-minute Skyway ride, though pleasant, was probably
costly to maintain, and Disney figured it could make better use of the space.”</p>

<p>The incident demonstrates a few principles regarding narrative and space. Whatever the official
story may be, the close proximity between Barlow’s death and shuttering the Skyway certainly seems
suspicious. Or at least it wouldn’t come as a surprise if the actual story differed from the official
account. More importantly, the two phenomena actually happened; Raymond Barlow died and the Skyway
closed down.  Despite all efforts to control a corporate image, sinister or practical, no imagineer
can stop people from dying at Disney. As for the ride, its removal further highlights erasure and
rewriting space. Sehlinger’s comments reflect practical business interests, but Barlow’s death adds
a macabre poignancy to the high costs of maintaining a theme park.</p>

<p>Around 30 people have died at Disney theme parks since 1977 (an exact figure is difficult to cobble
together). Most were the result of preexisting conditions or natural causes, what one report calls “not
surprising.” Some were the result of freak accidents. In many cases, families pursued legal action and
reached monetary settlements with the Disney corporation.  For reasons explored later in this text,
however, Raymond Barlow’s death stands out. The tour necessarily starts with him. </p>

<h3>Criticizing the Mouse</h3>

<p><i>“It’s company policy… If guests have the nerve to die, they wait, like unwanted calories, until
they’ve crossed the line and can do so safely off property. [...] Thus, no one gets sick or hurt at
Disney; no one dies at Disney, no one leaves Disney unhappy or is fired for no reason; and no one writes
bad things about the park once they’re gone.”—Inside the Mouse</i></p>

<p>That “no one dies at Disney” paints a dystopian picture of corporate control, mediation of park space
so authoritarian as to censor death itself. A cover-up. A conspiracy. Disney scrutinizes what enters and
leaves its property such that truth only circulates in the off-record whispers of its employees:</p>

<blockquote>We had a guy last summer who went to EPCOT, stood under the golf ball, took a gun, and blew
his head off. But he didn’t die. He stood right there in front of all those tourists and went “cluck” and
brains blew everywhere. But he didn’t die there. The medic told me that they are not allowed to let them
die there. Keep them alive by artificial means until they’re off Disney property, like there’s an imaginary
line in the road and they go, “He’s alive, he’s alive, he’s dead.”
(Qtd. in Inside the Mouse 115)</blockquote>

<p>The absurdity of it all–denial of a bullet in the brain’s finality, no further explanation of “artificial
means,” and of course the arbitrary border between life and death–contributes to and almost certainly stems
from Disney’s perceived omnipotence.</p>

<p>DDT is premised on an urban legend, the first challenge to our credibility. Online fact-checker Snopes.com
takes on the claim, “Disney can legitmately [sic] claim that no one has ever died at one of their theme parks, because
they always ensure that accident victims are removed from park property before being declared dead”
(“Declared Deaths at Disney”). Though it renders a “false” verdict, Snopes acknowledges “This legend is a
tricky subject to tackle, because it’s based upon the fine (and often confusing) distinction between actual
death and declared death.” To clarify our assumptions, at no point do we take for granted the Disney death
myth as law of the land. DDT instead explores how Disney deaths circulate within a network of lore, industry,
place, and community discourse.</p>

<p>Critical approaches to Disney theme parks are nothing new. Thibaut
Clément’s excellent review of literature traces the tension between
intellectual work and mass entertainment exemplified by Disney. Efforts
to identify the “locus of control” in Disney’s parks traversed the
high-brow/low-brow debates of the last century. Early intellectual
suspicion emerges as early as 1958. Other voices saw in Disneyland a
restoration of the public sphere, of performance and participation.
Recent work emphasizes the productive rather than pessimistic
possibilities in commercial tourist spaces:</p>

<blockquote>In assigning various degrees of agency to the parks’ participants,
critics have gradually displaced the locus of control for the parks’
meaning, design, and operations from the Disney corporation to the
individual user and the company’s socio-economic context, paying
increasing attention to the audience’s interpretive activity and the
parks’ competitive environment. (8)</blockquote>

<p>Thibaut concludes “Visitors are not ‘cultural dopes’ but rather actively
reconstruct available meanings to elaborate strategies and pursue
motives of their own” (8). Seeking the locus of control shifts from
identifying the presence of agency to the more nuanced assessment of
“how much credit the parks’ various participants must be given in
shaping and assigning meaning to the parks’ environment” (9).</p>

<p>In 1995, the cultural studies ensemble The Project on Disney published
<i>Inside the Mouse: Work and Play at Disney World</i>, which conducts a
critical examination of and in Disney theme parks. In part the book is a
model. It weighs the self-conscious guilt experienced by critics turned
tourists (“The Problem with Pleasure”), suggests playfully subversive
negotiations of park space (“The Alternative Ride”), and can’t resist a
degree of anti-authority snark (“Working at the Rat”). It also helps
circulate the “no one dies at Disney” legend as a counter-narrative
which escapes corporate oversight. For our purposes, the Project on
Disney serves as a precedent, a source for the myth, and ultimately a
point of departure.</p>

<p>By including an image of settled scholarship, we hope to clarify our
intentions for DDT—what it is, and what it is not. It is not an exposé
revealing corporate secrets, nor a critically aloof reading of Disney
parks. Neither do we wish to state the obvious: of course visitors
cultivate personal meanings in even the most mediated of spaces. Whereas
previous critical work formulates Disney parks in terms of either the
passive reception of signs or the active construction of individual
interpretations, of dominant ideologies or subversive subjectivities,
DDT introduces new writings into the space itself. At the same time, we
explore theories of writing and of writing in relation to space. DDT
employs as much its methods–MEmorality, psychogeography, augmented
reality, critical tourism–as an inquiry into the limits of our methods.</p>
