<h1>Memento Mortimer</h1>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="images/deathdance.png"></p>

<p><i>“I kissed my first girl while wearing a glow-in-the-dark Haunted Mansion shirt”</i>—Cory Doctorow</p>

<p><i>“By an extraordinary coincidence (but this derives without a doubt from
the enchantment inherent to this universe), this frozen, childlike world
is found to have been conceived and realized by a man who is himself now
cryogenized: Walt Disney, who awaits his resurrection through an increase
of 180 degrees centigrade.”</i>—Jean Baudrillard, <i>Simulacra and Simulation</i></p>

<h3>Memento (ME)mori(al)</h3>

<p>While the myth of Walt’s cryogenically frozen body is certainly
compelling, it is also undeniably untrue. Baudrillard’s mythologizing of
Disney enacts the same kind of covering up that critiques of Disney so
often hinge their critiques on. In reality, Walt was cremated two days
after his death, which was a result of complications from lung cancer
(Gabler ##). Walt was a heavy smoker for much of his life, and it led
to his death in 1966 at the age of 65.</p>

<p>In rearticulating the Disney-World-as-monument in our Disney Death Tour,
it is necessary to consider the ways The Walt Disney Company has itself
articulated its views on death. Most notable is the case of Walt
himself, whose portraits and various photographs throughout the park
have had the cigarettes carefully airbrushed from them, often leaving
two fingers delicately pointing towards nothing, or awkwardly extended
in front of him; some of these images still contain a faint smoke from
the missing cigarette, a secondhand reminder of what killed Walt (Cade).
Tom Hanks even mimicked the artificial two-finger point in his portrayal
of Walt in the 2013 film Saving Mr. Banks, yet another depiction void of
smoking but not of smoke (Buerger). We are not interrogating the ethics
of a revisionist approach to Walt’s image here, but would like to
emphasize that this seems endemic of a deep cultural unease with death
enacted at these parks.</p>

<p>That being said, there is one location at WDW that does portray
death—the Haunted Mansion, the Orlando version of which opened in 1971.
No deaths have been reported on the ride, but the ride is not without
its mythic depth. One ride operator we interviewed did tell us that the
ride shuts down several times a year to clean up ashes that have been
spread by park guests, presumably of loved ones who held a meaningful
connection to the ride. When we inquired if the ashes were collected and
stored somewhere, we were told that the process instead involved brooms
and vacuums. While this is a rumor in the strictest sense, it would
indicate that the playful irreverence of the attraction might bleed into
the logic of yet another of Disney’s death procedures. We highlight this
example to suggest that a playful logic at Disney can have stark
consequences, and that a subtle shift in this logic through electracy
can hold meaningful sway in constructing a spirited, inclusive image of
death in collective mourning.</p>

<p>And perhaps this used to be the case. Memento Mori, the gift shop
supplement of the Haunted Mansion, once sold customizable death
certificates (still need to fact check this), playful compositions that
juxtaposed the living with the dead. While these are now a thing of the
past, the shop does still offer what they call “Spirit Photography,”
personalized 8x10” holographic portraits that morph one’s face into that
of a ghoul’s when tilted. And even today the ghouls and phantoms darting
around within the walls of the Haunted Mansion engage in some of the
only implementation of augmented reality within the park, as if Disney
itself realizes the technology as one of communing with the dead. Their
mixed reality dancing indeed inspired our own haunting of the park, our
own Spirit Photography MEmorial that works within the preexisting
electrate logics of Walt Disney World.</p>

<h3>Monumental Mice</h3>

<p>It goes without saying that Mickey Mouse has become more than just the
official mascot of The Walt Disney Company, but also one of the most
famous cartoon characters in the world. But the iconic mouse was
originally named Mortimer, a name often associated with death and the
grim reaper, whose etymology can be traced back to Middle English and
Latin (mors and mort-, death)[1]. On the behest of Walt’s wife
Lillian, the name was changed to Mickey, on the basis that the name
Mortimer was too pretentious. But Mortimer did eventually become a
character in the Disney Universe, making his first appearance as the
villain “Mr. Slicker” in the 1930 comic strip “Mr. Slicker and the Egg
Robbers,” and his first appearance with the name Mortimer Mouse six
years later in the animated short “Mickey’s Rival,” where he firmly
cements his place in Disney’s history as Mickey’s primary antagonist.</p>

<p>A psychoanalytic or literary reading of this might view Mortimer Mouse
as a repressed death drive or id. By suppressing the mouse’s true
Mortimer nature by naming him Mickey, a villain bearing the name comes
to surface. Of course, we would rather consider Mortimer in a difference
sense—as our own mascot for death within the borders of Walt Disney
World. Although countless other villains have their own mascots within
the park, there has never been a live Mortimer.</p>

<p>In implementing our mascot to rewrite the images of hidden deaths
throughout the park, we are also riffing off of Disney’s “Hidden
Mickeys,” the concealed insertions of the iconic tri-circle Mickey head
throughout Disney parks. Just as Hidden Mickeys started as an in-joke
between early Disney Imagineers and has become a favorite means of
secretly participating in the parks’ community (Roseboom), our MEmorial
application Hidden Mortimers began as a shared, hidden means of
rewriting the park, and one that we now offer up to the larger
community. Just as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Dr. Mortimer asks Sherlock
Holmes to investigate the death of his friend in The Hound of the
Baskervilles, so too do our Mortimers call for a closer examination, a
second look at what it means to be a visitor of the parks. Our memento
mori is not a morbid or repressed action, but rather an attempt at an
artful reflection on death.</p>

<p>[1] It’s also important to note that Mickey Mouse’s design was
influenced by early 20th century caricatures of blackface, as detailed
throughout the collection A Mickey Mouse Reader, edited by Gary Apgar.</p>
