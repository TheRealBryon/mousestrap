<h1>Mapping Death</h1>

<p><img class="img-responsive" src="img/mapshot.png"></p>

<p><i>"[T]he limits of memory and representation serve to remind composition
scholars of the significant roles pre-reflective sensations play in our everyday
lives and the responsibilities we hold at the same time to guard against their
theorization or memorialization as such in writing."</i>
<br>—Scot Barnett, "Psychogeographies of Writing"</br></p>

<p>This is the hardest section to write. In formulating this project, we
knew that we wanted to say something, more specifically to write
something, but agonized over the exact questions of why and how. In our
concern not to instrumentalize the dead, to appropriate tragedy for our
creative intents, ethical considerations provide the basis for a
methodology. Of course the dead cannot write for themselves, but neither
do we wish to presume their voices for them. Though this map gives only
a crude representation of the dead at Disney, indicating their hidden
presence is a step towards articulating the dead in a distributed
subjectivity network.</p>

<h3>The Limits of Critique</h3>

<p>Scot Barnett introduces his “Psychogeographies of Writing” as rhetoric
and composition develops “new maps of writing” (Reynolds) at the
“spatial turn.” We pay heed to writing’s “limits of representation” as
we create an alternative mapping of WDW. AR and other ubiquitous digital
writing tools figure as democratic technologies, seemingly capable of
empowering users to inscribe public spaces with emancipatory
counter-narratives. Barnett, however, examines the problematics of any
writing:</p>

<blockquote>Although attempting to unmask and demystify hidden power relations
can satisfy in the short term, doing so also has the potential to leave in
place the very thing we hoped to transcend—in this case the problem of
yet another representation of space quietly asserting its own truth or
authenticity.</blockquote>

<p>DDT attempts to demystify hidden power relations at work in WDW.
However, as part of our methodology, we “acknowledge and work creatively
with those irreducible aspects of embodied being-in-the-world that haunt
the accounts we offer of ourselves but that may never find a comfortable
place in the discourses we rely upon to represent and memorialize those
accounts."</p>

<p>Critical tourism is the participation through travel in a contest for
writing spaces. It involves the embodied experience of tourism as
being-in-the-world. Disney represents a highly mediated writing space as
well as an iconic tourist space. Ubiquitous mobile computing
technologies enable users to introduce unsanctioned personal narratives
in officially mediated spaces. In light of Barnett’s admonishments,
however, we must be careful not to replace one totalizing narrative with
another. We must, in short, acknowledge the limits of critiques
contingent upon the limits of representation. DDT seeks ways to tarry
with “the limits that accompany our abilities to conceive or represent
space (and our being-in space) in the first place.” We consider the
implications of being-in-Disney-World as critical actants and
phenomenological reactants.</p>

<p>DDT takes the form of a MEmorial which visually commemorates those who
have lost their lives at Disney. Employed in such works as Augmented
VÉlorutionaries and Roadkill Tollbooth, the MEmorial genre is “not
intended to condemn or pass judgment, but instead visualize the
invisible sacrifices made on behalf of certain cultural or national
values (xiii).” Neither is the MEmorial parody, as Morey insists that
the “overall intent is serious.” As a counter-narrative to WDW’s highly
mediated spaces and depictions of life and death, DDT provides a means
of rumination and reflection on some of the often invisible consequences
of modern tourism and entertainment. Moreover, DDT explores the limits
and possibilities of the MEmorial genre as distinct from memorial
representations.</p>

<p>The inadequacy of representation to account for the irreducible aspects
of being-in-the-world leads us to work against “the discourses we rely
upon to represent and memorialize those accounts” (Barnett). We treat
skeptically the notion of preserving or retrieving memory. By
acknowledging the limits of representation, we look for ways of seeing
without knowing. How do we see without knowing, and moreover, how do we
write without knowing? How do we employ “a language that continuously
interrupts the will to craft a narrative out of memory"?</p>

<h3>Death Rhetoric</h3>

<p>Emplaced thanatourism forwards an ethics attuned to the material
specifics of place rather than tropes in abstraction. Letting place
speak disperses the topoi of the modernist project into the chora of
electracy. In our eagerness to memorialize those who have died in a
high-profile space, however, we risk instrumentalizing the dead, a kind
of critical profiteering. To avoid containing the irreducible
complexities of lived experience to simple obituary, we must ask
ourselves two questions: what happens when we introduce death into
considerations of lived spatiality, and how do we leave “open and
unresolved the impasse between memory and the immemorial”? The former
reflects intellectual curiosity, the desire to advance the field. The
latter demands doing so ethically.</p>

<p>For Barnett, writing commits violence when it asserts narrative
singularity. On our map you find indications of those who have
physically died; the challenge before us is to avoid doubling down on
ethical violence. Citing Judith Butler, Barnett explains,</p>

<blockquote>“an act of ethical violence occurs when we ask of the other the
question ‘who are you?’ and demand in return a satisfactory response
capable of presenting a clear and coherent image of the other’s self.
Though often couched in the name of ethics, such acts, Butler has
argued, nevertheless demand of the other something she cannot possibly
provide—namely, an account of the self that is self-identical with the
‘I’ in whose name she speaks.”</blockquote>

<p>Articulating death merely exacerbates writing’s failure to represent
what not even the living other can present as a coherent self.</p>

<p>Though we may not be able to substitute writing for the memory of lived
experience, we can invoke death’s rhetoricity. According to Diane Davis,
“Death marks the absolute limit of identification and (so) of
understanding” (“A Rhetoric of Responsibility”). The living cannot offer
up the entire experience of self, but only the dead can reveal life:
“‘my’ finitude…can communicate itself to me only through ‘your’
mortality.” Davis offers a model of rhetoric [nonviolent expropriation]...</p>

<p>Death’s revelation is rhetorical appeal to action. When “communal life holds
itself ‘at a level equal to death,’” responsibility emerges as the behaviors accordant
to life’s ultimate consequence. Disney Death Tour invites the dead as <i>memento
responsabilitas</i>. Though the MEmorial is not inherently polemic, but instead an
exploration of community values, the form nevertheless includes this condition:
“If when confronted with the visibility of these losses, argued Ulmer, and we do
not see such sacrifices as worth the cost, then we must change our values and
attitudes” (Ghost Bikes). Our tour visualizes abject sacrifice, but we forward
no explicit agenda regarding change–seeing without knowing. By recognizing
structural death at Disney as a site of communal values in addition to entertainment,
by writing death into the Magic Kingdom outside its containerized depiction at
the Haunted Mansion, Disney Death Tour opens the potential for otherwise suppressed
(re)considerations.</p>

<h3>Punctum Notifications</h3>

<p><i>“Toward the integration of the body with digital information, electracy
‘proposes that direct access to databases must be through “mindbodies,”
engaging mappings among orifices, brain, culture, and technics’”
–Avatar Emergency</i>, qtd. in Morey</p>

<p><i>“...down from all/ Heights all levels of American breath layered in the
lungs from the frail/ Chill of space to the loam where extinction
slumbers...”</i>—James L. Dickey, “Falling”</p>

<p>“Death Drive(r)s” is a mobile augmented reality app which overlays digital
markers at the sites of ghost bikes. The MEmorial app is a double reminder of both
the loss of cyclists’ lives and the removal of the physical monuments to them. To
alert users to hidden presence, Greene and Jones suggest utilizing smart phones’
push-notifications: “In this way, the digital (re)placement would work in a similar
way to the physical ghost bike in that members of the public could not avoid knowing
that death occurred at this location.” GPS-triggered push notifications extract
salience from ambience. Environs already suffused with meaning, in this case the
unseen presence of death, “push” salient information to the fore.</p>

<p>Ours and other AR projects act like a sixth sense; we see dead people. But in
attempting ways of “seeing without knowing,” in Barnett’s terms, our tour avoids
imposing additional narratives to the phenomena of these deaths. At the same time,
we must acknowledge that within a model of distributed subjectivity, individual
actors still testify to their networked situations. Furthermore, in alignment with
Ulmer’s phrase “the community in me” (Internet Invention), what we see is as much a
reflection of ourselves as any attempt to name the other.</p>

<p>A MEmorial begins with a wound, the punctum. Set apart from studium, reliably
predictable connotative meaning, punctum describes defiantly personalized affective response.
Uncannily, Barthes explicates his theory of punctum with an example of death, a photograph
of a prisoner prior to his hanging, of which Barthes remarks that the “photograph is handsome,
as is the boy: the is the studium. The punctum is: he is going to die. I read at the same
time. This will be and this has been; I observe with horror an anterior future of which death
is the stake” (96). Further defining punctum, Quinn R. Gorman ascribes to it two features:
“the detail that seems to resist the photographer’s intentions” and that which “bears on time
and death” (247). Thus the punctum generates a highly individualized alter-narrative to controlled
space and puts the me in MEmorial.</p>

<p>This tour began with Raymond Barlow’s death. His stands out, stings, in ways I* can only
attempt to explain. Thus, punctum indicates what Barnett calls irreducible, pre-reflexive
experience. Drawing from Christian Nold’s biomapping, substituting biofeedback sensors with
this notion of punctum, I can map onto my pre-reflexive response a narrative explanation of
its significance. Our Disney Death Tour encourages other thanotourists to explore their own
creative alter-narratives generated by “punctum-notifications.”</p>
